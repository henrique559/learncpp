# How to Think Like a Programmer 

## 1 - Strategies for Problem Solving

- `Problem Solving`: It's about ***Solving*** the problem and not avoiding it, normally when we are programming something difficult that doesnt seem to work we give up and avoid that problem thinking something like "oh, my solution only works if there are X things but it's suposed to work with Y things, it's better to do something else than trying to solve this."
- `Classic Puzzles`: We can use analogy to solve problems using that to thinking a solution to a problem A using the idea that solved the problem B, which is similar to the problem A, classic problems outside the programming world can help us to get into this approach.
- `The Fox, The Goose, and the Corn`: We can learn with this problem that restating a problem with a formal manner is a great techinique to gain insight into a problem or exercise to have new thoughts about the solution of that question.

Thinking about ***the problem*** is more productive than thinking about the solution of the problem, as you can see new ways and get new perspectives to solve that part of the code.

- `Sliding tile puzzles`: Sometimes it's not possible to see a clear way to solve a programming problem, but we can make some strategies to approach a better solution for that.
- `Sudoku`:
